/*
You are given a method called main, make it print the line Hello World! and don't return anything

Note that for some languages, the function main is the entry point of the program.

Here's how it will be tested:

    java Solution.class parameter1 parameter2

Hints:

    Check your references
    Think about the scope of your method
    For prolog you can use write but there are better ways
    If you still don't get it probably you can define main as an attribute of the Solution class that accepts a single argument, and that only prints "Hello World!" without any return.

public class ClassicHelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
